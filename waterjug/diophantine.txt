    Problem: You are at the side of a river. You have a "a" liter jug and a "b" liter jug. The jugs do not have markings to allow measuring smaller quantities. How can you use the jugs to measure "c" liter of water?

Representing the problem in equation: ax + by = c where

x = number of time one jug is poured/discharged(+ve/-ve)

y = number of time the other jug is poured/discharged(+ve/-ve)

    Theorem. The Diophantine equation ax+by = c is solvable if and only if gcd(a, b) divides c.

Corner case :c must satisfy: c <= max(a,b)

    Simulation:

You must simulate by doing "pouring action" only in one jug and "discharging action" only in the opposite jug.

(1)pour in a, discharge in b: if a is empty pour a full, if b is full the discharge and make b empty. Otherwise, transfer water from a to b. Each of those three condition is a step & can happen only once at a time.

(2)pour in b, discharge in a: if b is empty pour it full, if a is full make it empty. Otherwise, transfer water from b to a.

count total steps for (1) and (2), the minimum is the answer.

for (1) simulation can be:

//x=capacity of a, y = capacity of b

 a = b = count = 0; //initially

while(a != c && b != c)

{

if(a == 0)

{

a = x;

}

else if(b == y)

{

b = 0;

}

else //transfer from a to b

{

b = b+a;

a = 0;

if(b > y)

{

a = b-y;

b = y;

}

}

count ++;

//cout<<a<<" "<<b<<endl;///steps

}

for (2) : start from b instead of a.
